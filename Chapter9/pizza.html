Good, you have succeeded.<BR>You should now understand the following:
<!-- The Commandments --><UL> 
<LI>Pizza is the <A HREF="secret.html">holy one</A>.
<LI>Pizza is the only one.
<LI>The following do not abide by this code:
<OL><LI>Everything that isn't pizza
<LI>Anything that attempts to be a loophole. Nothing escapes.</OL>
<LI>If any of the aforementioned is consumed, you must seek cleansing.
<LI>This is pizza's creed.</UL>

Now, find the secret pizza hidden somewhere within the creed.<BR>
If you are truly enlightened, you may have already found it.
